            <p>Monarch Matte Paste is the best hair product that actually work well with my hair.
                What I like about is that there are many different kind of paste to choose from.
                It doesn't matter if you have thin, thick, or curly hair they have different variety of
                paste that work well with your hair type.

            <h3>Henning S.</h3>
            <p>I did like the Matt paste overall very much but I really struggled to keep the hair in place
                when I was at work or doing some minor exercises which mostly dissolved the paste. This lead to
                my hair style falling apart BTW in the winter I now made curls so don't have to worry about it anymore.
                But I can imagine that you can struggle with this especially in the summer and moist climate.
                Hope you can work on that although I can understand it as it needs to be water dissolve able but I don't
                really want to carry my styling paste with me.</p>
